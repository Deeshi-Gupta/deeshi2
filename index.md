## Deeshi's Blog 
Hi. My name is Deeshi and Welcome to my Blog. I am a current sophmore here at DNHS and I was raised in Chula Vista before moving here. I am a member of the SACS Club. I like dancing and cooking in my freetime.

My freeform image has my family which consists of my parents, my brother, and me. It also has my dog who is 2 and a half and he is pure english lab. I also added the indian flag because it is my home country.
